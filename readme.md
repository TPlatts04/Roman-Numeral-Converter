# Roman Numeral Converter

This is a small project which was made using basic HTML5, CSS3 and JS.
The project here was for a requested project via freecodecamp (2/5) which goes towards me achieving my certification for 
_**JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures (Beta).**_
This simple **Roman Numeral Converter** allows you to input a number between 1 and 3999, then the program will generate the inputted value in roman numerals. It will throw
any errors and produce that error on screen if the user enters any of these values: less than or equal to 0, more than or equal to 4000, no number in input. This can be used for a 
variety of tasks, one main task could be teaching children when showing them the Roman topics. This algorithm manipulates the DOM and uses Objects and basic logic to perform
these actions.
